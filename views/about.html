            <p>Christopher Adam Bumstead (born 2 February 1995) is a Canadian IFBB professional bodybuilder. Bumstead is the

            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>Bumstead was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, where he was involved in multiple sports through his
                childhood, playing football, baseball, basketball, and hockey in high school. He started weightlifting at
                the age of 14, and between the ninth and twelfth grade, he went from 170 to 225 pounds, growing his legs the
                most. After building what he thought was a good physique, Bumstead met his sister's boyfriend, professional
                bodybuilder Iain Valliere, who has coached him since.</p>
